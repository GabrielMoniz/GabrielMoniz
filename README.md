Here are some ideas to get you started:

### Hello! ğŸ‘‹ I'm Gabriel Moniz

I'm a PhD student at the Physics Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I work on quantum information, focusing on using self-testing to certify quantum devices. My research merges the foundations of quantum mechanics with practical applications in quantum computing.

Iâ€™m passionate about **quantum computation** and **machine learning** and am always excited to explore projects that push the boundaries of these fields. This repository is a collection of my research projects, code, and experiments. Thanks for stopping by!
